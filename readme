Prelims:

- Install Anaconda. The quickest way to manage python on Windows --> https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

- Launch Anaconda CMD.

- Additional package is pyautogui. Install this by executing: pip install pyautogui 

- Copy the unlock.py script from this repo and save this to your working directory.

- With Conda CMD, change directory to where you saved the unlock.py.

- Execute: pythonw unlock.py.

- To run the script -> pythonw unlock.py  # this will run the unlock script in the background.

Tidbits:

- The script will press the NUM LOCK key for you every 480 seconds. You can set that time in the script, look for time.sleep.

- It also generates a logfile to know if the script ran.

Optionals:
  - pip install pyinstaller  --> to compile
  - pip install PyQt5  --> compilation needs this pack
  - pyinstaller -w unlock.py  --> this will compile
  
  Disclaimer:
  
  - By using the script/program/app/software, you agree that I don't take any blame for whatever that could happen.
